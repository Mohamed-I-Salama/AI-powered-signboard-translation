# AI-powered-signboard-translation
This project builds a real-time system that detects, translates, and overlays text from signboards using deep learning. It combines OCR, translation models, and image processing to assist travelers and language learners. Trained on COCO-Text and TextOCR, it improves speed and accuracy over previous methods.
